# Placeholder module for your generator/simulator/confirm logic.
# You will paste your working “optimizer” code here later and expose functions like:
#
# def run_phase_1_and_2(config: dict) -> dict: ...
# def confirm_phase_3(saved_file: str, nwj: dict) -> dict: ...
#
# Return plain Python dicts so app.py can render them easily.
